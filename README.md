# SQL_INTERN_TASK5
### This project demonstrates how to create and relate two database tables: Customers and Orders. It includes:
Creating tables with primary and foreign key constraints.
Inserting sample data into both tables.
Performing various SQL joins:
### INNER JOIN to get matching records.
### LEFT JOIN to show all customers and their orders.
## RIGHT JOIN to show all orders and their customers.
### FULL OUTER JOIN to combine all records from both tables.
These queries help understand relational data and how different types of joins work in SQL.
